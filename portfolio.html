      I've been fortunate to work on a diverse set of high impact projects in my career. I've
      gathered together highlights and projects with open code here.

        <h4>NSIDC Search and Arctic Data Explorer <small>2012 - 2014</small></h4>

        <div class="description">
          A large project at NSIDC to provide two interfaces for search and discovery of scientific data. NSIDC Search
          exposes NSIDC held datasets. Arctic Data Explorer is an interface for arctic datasets from roughly a dozen
          data centers. Both interfaces share a common code base and depend on shared REST services. I contributed
          to this project as architect and as a full stack developer on an agile team. Most of the code repositories
          are open source, however when they were open sourced the history was deleted so it isnâ€™t possible to find
          my commits.

        <h4>NCEI Common Ingest <small>2015</small></h4>
        <div class="description">NCEI Common Ingest is a data file ingest system that includes file transformations and
          processing. The project was established before I joined NCEI. After the 2015 work the system was recognized
          as a leading solution in NCEI for data ingest and has been adopted by other NCEI sites for handling data
          ingest. This was made possible by design refactoring I led in 2015 which drastically reduced the cost
          (estimated 10x) of adding new data streams to the ingest system. NCEI Common Ingest is a private project.</div>

        <img class="project-screenshot"  src="images/apps/water-column-sonar_700.png" alt="...">
        <div class="description">Real time processing system for GOES-R satellite data. This system monitors the
          file system to process incoming data files through roughly 25 separate algorithms. The project coordinates
          the algorithms but algorithms them selves were created by another team. SPADES Control Segment is a
          private project.</div>

        <h4>Bowling Challenge <small>2016</small></h4>
        <div class="description">The bowling challenge is my solution to a code challenge provided as part of an
          interview process. It was written in the language and style of my choice, TDD and Node.js. The bowling
          challenge is a command line javascript application that scores a game of bowling, taking in integers
          and printing the score for the game when complete.
