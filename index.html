    <h2>What I Do <small><a href="services.html">more info</a></small></h2>
    <p>
      As a full stack freelance software developer I create custom applications, maintain existing applications and
      provide software engineering leadership. I'm passionate about using my skills to solve problems and help people.
      Besides great problem solving and a well rounded skill set I have specific experience in search and
      discovery, GIS and science applications. I was previously the architect for a group of 20 developers and have
      experience designing and evolving systems with many coordinating parts.

    <h2>About Me <small><a href="about.html">more info</a></small></h2>
    <p>
      I started my career by earning a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Colorado. I worked
      at <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/">Xilinx</a> as a senior software engineer, the <a href="http://nsidc.org/">National Snow and Ice Data Center</a>
      as architect and senior software engineer and at the
      <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/">National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)</a> as a senior software
      engineer. In July of 2016 I started Billingsley Custom Software LLC.

      I live in Boulder with my amazing wife and two children. When I'm not at my desk you can often find me outside enjoying
      cycling, skiing, tennis, hiking and camping or inside reading a book, playing games or cooking.
