      Billingsley Custom Software was founded in July of 2016 by Brendan Billingsley with a mission of creating custom
      software solutions that help people and the planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to founding Billingsley Custom Software Brendan worked for 14 years as a software engineer. Most recently
      Brendan was a software engineer at <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/">National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)</a>
      where he contributed as a full stack software developer on multiple projects supporting ingest, archive, analysis,
      processing, discovery and extract of scientific data. He led a successful effort reducing software team development
      effort by an estimated 10x for adding new data streams to the data ingest system.
      Brendan transformed engineering practices of the team to significantly increase productivity and quality of code. He
      also led adoption of continuous build, delivery, linting, unit and e2e testing for new applications. Brendan
      served as scrum master and was instrumental in improving the NCEI agile processes including introducing
      lean and XP practices to the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 2008 to 2014 Brendan worked at the <a href="http://nsidc.org/">National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)</a> where he started
      as a software engineer and was later promoted to architect for a team of about 20 developers. While at NSIDC Brendan
      worked on a team that designed and implemented enterprise systems for creation, maintenance, curation,
      search, discovery and extract of scientific data. He received a CIRES Service Award for contributions as
      architect and lead developer for search and discovery applications at NSIDC.
      Brendan also led adoption of agile methodologies including Scrum, Lean, Kanban and XP practices both as scrum master
      and as architect. He created and led multiple seminars for developers teaching Java basics, debugging,
      unit testing, Hibernate, JPA, Spring, PostgreSQL and PostGIS. In the architect role he presented posters and demos
      at conferences and represented NSIDC to skake holders and funders presenting and discussing system architecture and implementations.

      From 2003 to 2008 Brendan was at
      <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/">Xilinx</a> where he was promoted to a senior software engineer position.
      While at <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/">Xilinx</a> Brendan developed his enterprise software engineering skills
      by working on multiple enterprise applications supporting testing Xilinx software on an 800 node cluster. Brendan's
      role also gave him daily experience in gathering requirements and supporting operational software with customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brendan got his start in software engineering by completing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
      from the University of Colorado in 2002. He was hired by The Brainard Group where he had been an intern and
      spent one year working in a high impact position in a small company before moving on to Xilinx.
